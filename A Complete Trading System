Most successful traders use a mechanical trading system.
This is not a coincidence.
A good mechanical trading system automates the entire process of trading.
The system provides answers for each of the decisions a trader must make while trading.
It makes it easier for a trader to trade consistently because there is a set of rules that specifically define exactly what should be done.
The mechanics of trading are not left up to the judgment of the trader.

If you know that your system makes money over the long run, it is easier to take the signals and trade according to the system during periods of losses.
If you are relying on your own judgment when you are trading, you may find that you are fearful when you should be bold and courageous when you should be cautious.

If you have a mechanical trading system that works and follow it consistently, your trading will be consistent despite the inner emotional struggles that may result from a long series of losses or a large profit.
The confidence, consistency, and discipline afforded by a thoroughly tested mechanical system are the key to many of the most profitable tradersâ€™ success.

The Turtle Trading System was a complete trading system.
Its rules covered every aspect of trading and left no decisions to the subjective whims of the trader.
It had every component of a complete trading system that covers each of the decisions required for successful trading:
Markets: What to buy or sell
Position Sizing: How much to buy or sell
Entries: When to buy or sell
Stops: When to get out of a losing position
Exits: When to get out of a winning position
Tactics: How to buy or sell
