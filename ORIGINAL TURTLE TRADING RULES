I always say that you could publish my trading rules in the newspaper and no one would follow them.
The key is consistency and discipline.
Almost anybody can make up a list of rules that are 80% as good as what we taught our people.
What they couldn’t do is give them the confidence to stick to those rules even when things are going bad.
—Richard Dennis, quoted in Market Wizards by Jack D. Schwager
